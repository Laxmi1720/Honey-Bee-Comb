# üêù Honey Bee Breeding - Honeycomb Cell Distance Analyzer

### **Description**

This project provides a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for analyzing **honeycomb cell distances** in the context of honey bee breeding.
The GUI is developed using **Python's Tkinter library**, offering an intuitive way to:

* **Calculate shortest paths** between labeled cells on a honeycomb structure
* **Visualize path tracing**
* Ensure **input validation**
* Provide **user-friendly interaction** through GUI components

This tool helps users explore and understand **honeycomb geometry and bee breeding patterns** efficiently.
